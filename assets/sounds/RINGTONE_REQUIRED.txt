IMPORTANT: Ringtone Audio File Required
========================================

A ringtone audio file named "ringtone.mp3" must be placed in this directory for the incoming call feature to work properly.

File Requirements:
- Filename: ringtone.mp3
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 3-5 seconds (will loop automatically)
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz
- Bit Rate: 128 kbps or higher
- Volume: Normalized to prevent distortion

Where to Get a Ringtone:
1. Free Sound Libraries:
   - https://freesound.org/ (search for "phone ringtone")
   - https://www.zapsplat.com/ (free sound effects)
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/phone/ (royalty-free)

2. Create Your Own:
   - Use Audacity (free audio editor)
   - Use online tone generators
   - Record and edit your own sound

3. For Testing:
   - Any MP3 file can be used as a temporary placeholder
   - Just rename it to "ringtone.mp3"

Implementation Details:
- The ringtone plays automatically when an incoming call screen is displayed
- It loops continuously until the call is accepted or rejected
- The audio player is managed by the RingtoneService class
- Volume is set to maximum (1.0) for clear notification

Next Steps:
1. Download or create a ringtone.mp3 file
2. Place it in this directory (chattrix-ui/assets/sounds/)
3. The app will automatically use it for incoming calls
