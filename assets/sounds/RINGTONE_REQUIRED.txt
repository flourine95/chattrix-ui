Where to Get a Ringtone:
------------------------
1. Free Sound Libraries (Royalty-Free):
   - https://freesound.org/ (search for "phone ringtone")
   - https://www.zapsplat.com/ (free sound effects)
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/phone/ (royalty-free)
   - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/ringtone/

2. Create Your Own:
   - Use Audacity (free audio editor)
   - Use online tone generators (e.g., onlinetonegenerator.com)
   - Record and edit your own sound

3. Quick Testing:
   - Any MP3 file can be used as a temporary placeholder
   - Just rename it to "ringtone.mp3" and place it here

Usage Example:
--------------
```dart
// Get the service from provider
final ringtoneService = ref.read(ringtoneServiceProvider);

// Start playing (will loop automatically)
await ringtoneService.play();

// Stop playing
await ringtoneService.stop();

// Clean up when done
await ringtoneService.dispose();
```

Integration Points:
-------------------
- IncomingCallScreen: Plays ringtone when displayed
- Call acceptance: Stops ringtone via CallStateNotifier
- Call rejection: Stops ringtone via CallStateNotifier
- Call timeout: Stops ringtone automatically

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Download or create a ringtone.mp3 file
2. Place it in this directory (chattrix-ui/assets/sounds/)
3. Run the app - the ringtone will play for incoming calls
4. Test by initiating a call from another user

Note: The app will throw an error if ringtone.mp3 is missing when
      an incoming call is received. Add the file before testing calls.
