## Ringtone

**File:** `ringtone.mp3`

**Purpose:** Played when an incoming call invitation is received.

**Requirements:**
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 3-5 seconds (will loop automatically)
- Volume: Normalized to prevent distortion
- Recommended: Pleasant, non-intrusive tone suitable for call notifications

**Note:** You need to add a `ringtone.mp3` file to this directory. You can:
1. Use a royalty-free ringtone from sources like freesound.org or zapsplat.com
2. Create a custom ringtone using audio editing software
3. Use a simple tone generator to create a basic ringtone

For testing purposes, you can use any MP3 file as a placeholder.
